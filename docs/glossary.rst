Some Terms
----------

* Accuracy
The degree to which the mean of a sample approaches the true mean of the population; lack of bias.

* Activity
A practice or ensemble of practices that take place on a delineated area over a given period of time.

* Baseline
A reference scenario against which a change in greenhouse gas emissions or removals is measured.

* Bias
Systematic over- or under-estimation of a quantity.

* Biosphere
That component of the Earth system that contains life in its var- ious forms, which includes its living organisms and derived organic matter (e.g., litter, detritus, soil).

* Carbon Flux
Transfer of carbon from one carbon pool to another in units of measurement of mass per unit area and time (e.g., t C ha-1 y-1).

* Carbon Pool
A reservoir. A system which has the capacity to accumulate or release carbon. Examples of carbon pools are forest biomass, wood products, soils, and atmosphere. The units are mass (e.g., t C).

* Carbon Stock
The absolute quantity of carbon held within a pool at a specified time.

* Flux
See “Carbon Flux.”

* Forest Estate
A forested landscape consisting of multiple stands of trees.

* Forest Stand
A community of trees, including aboveground and below- ground biomass and soils, sufficiently uniform in species composition, age, arrangement, and condition to be managed as a unit.

* Heterotrophic Respiration
The release of carbon dioxide from decomposition of organic matter.

* Land Cover
The observed physical and biological cover of the Earth’s land as vegetation or man-made features.

* Land Use
The total of arrangements, activities, and inputs undertaken in a certain land cover type (a set of human actions). The social and economic purposes for which land is managed (e.g., grazing, tim- ber extraction, conservation).

* Permanence
The longevity of a carbon pool and the stability of its stocks, given the management and disturbance environment in which it occurs.

* Pool
See Carbon Pool.

*  Practice
An action or set of actions that affect the land, the stocks of pools associated with it or otherwise affect the exchange of greenhouse gases with the atmosphere.

* Precision
The repeatability of a measurement (e.g., the standard error of the sample mean).

* Regeneration
The renewal of a stand of trees through either natural means (seeded on-site or adjacent stands or deposited by wind, birds, or animals) or artificial means (by planting seedlings or direct seeding).

* Reservoir
A pool.

* Sequestration
The process of increasing the carbon content of a carbon pool other than the atmosphere.

* Shifting Agriculture
A form of forest use common in tropic forests where an area of forest is cleared, or partially cleared, and used for cropping for a few years until the forest regenerates. Also known as slash and burn agriculture, moving agriculture, or swidden agriculture.

* Sink
Any process or mechanism which removes a greenhouse gas, an aerosol, or a precursor of a greenhouse gas from the atmos- phere. A given pool (reservoir) can be a sink for atmospheric

* Source
Opposite of sink. A carbon pool (reservoir) can be a source of carbon to the atmosphere if less carbon is flowing into it than is flowing out of it.

* Stand
See Forest Stand.

* Stock
See Carbon Stock.

* Soil Carbon Pool
Used here to refer to the relevant carbon in the soil. It includes var- ious forms of soil organic carbon (humus) and inorganic soil carbon and charcoal. It excludes soil biomass (e.g., roots, bulbs, etc.) as well as the soil fauna (animals).

* Uptake
The addition of carbon to a pool. A similar term is sequestration.

* Wood Products
Products derived from the harvested wood from a forest, including fuelwood and logs and the products derived from them such as sawn timber, plywood, wood pulp, paper, etc.
