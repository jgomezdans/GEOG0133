Measurement
==============

Introduction
------------

In the previous lectures, we have dealt with the general context for wanting to monitor and model land surface processes and terrestrial carbon exchanges in particular. We have also deal with how these carbon processes are currently modelled in DGVMs and similar tools. We have emphasises the terrestrial vegetation components throughout, as (as we shall see) this is where remote sensing data have most to directly offer (it is difficult at best to monitor soil carbon stocks and fluxes from EO).

In this lecture, we will introduce ideas of measurement of quantities pertinent to terrestrial carbon. The material presented will be an overview only that students are expected to read through. The 'lecture' session this week will be run as a set of student-led seminars on particular aspects of this material (details below).

Broadly, we need to concern ourselves with: 

* measurement of stocks (i.e. how much carbon is there in different pools (e.g. leaf, wood, roots)) and what are the (longer term) changes in these stocks?);
* measurement of fluxes (i.e. what are the rates (on short time scales, seconds, hours, days, or months) of carbon exchenges and how are these partitioned (e.g. GPP, respiration)?);

We can more simply state that as 'state' and 'rates'.

Measurement and inference of Stocks
-----------------------------------

Biomass density from ground data and allometric relationships
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The 'simplest' (or at least the most direct way) way of measuring carbon stocks is destructive measurement (i.e. chop down a tree and measure the carbon content of the leaves and wood: roots are in any case more tricky), but clearly it would be fruitless to remove all terrestrial carbon stocks just to measure them. Because of this, sampling is required. Because of the historical interest of 'foresters' in timber, various efficient ways have been devised to estimate timber volume. Examples of this include Brown et al. (1989) who attempt to establish protocols for above ground biomass (AGB) for tropical forests. Note that 'foresters' estimates of 'useable timber' AGB will always be lower than the total AGB.

Most of these methods use measures 'easy' to obtain in the field to calibrate 'allometric' relationships with timber volume of AGB. Most typically the core measurement is DBH (trunk diameter at breast height). Sometimes, different allometric relationships are applied for different classes of tree (e.g. species for forestry, or other classifications for AGB estimates).

*Scatterplot of AGB (kg) against DBH (cm) from Brown et al. (1989)*

Note that there may be significant scatter, especially for higher biomass levels in such relationships. Other terms may be used to contribute to the allometric relationships, such as tree height and wood density or specific gravity. Since area-based estimates are typically required, some way of accounting for number density is also required. Since not all tree components are generally sampled or accounted for 'expansion factors' may generally be required to account for these.

In reviewing this subject, you should consider the likely accuracy of such measurements and the complexities involved. You should also consider other ground-based methods that are applied and some of the methods applied to scaling up estimates (e.g. simple regression/GIS modelling). You will find the FAO primer by Brown (1997) useful for this.

You should also consider how these methods are/can be used to monitor biomass change.

It would also be of relevance to make yourself aware of REDD+.

You might also like to consider how the below ground components of vegetation carbon stocks can be estimated/measured, as well as soil carbon.

Ground-based measurements of leaf area
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As with biomass, measurement of LAI can be carried out destructively, but this is time consuming and costly. It is more usual therefore to apply methods that in some way rely on measurements of canopy transmission or gap fraction. A typical example of the former is the LAI2000 instrumentAs with biomass, measurement of LAI can be carried out destructively, but this is time consuming and costly. It is more usual therefore to apply methods that in some way rely on measurements of canopy transmission or gap fraction. A typical example of the former is the LAI2000 instrument that i that i measurement is taken above and below a canopy, and the transmission inferred. From this, LAI is then inferred. Care must be taken in using this instrument and interpreting the data, as factors such as clumping are not well-treated and the measure is essentially an 'effective' LAI.

More generally, some measure of gap fraction is used (see e.g. Welles & Cohen, 1996). In recent years, the use of digital photography (with a fisheye lens) has become commonplace.

You will find that there is much repetative literature in this area.

Ground-based measurements of LAI (and related fractional cover) are also very important for the 'validation' of satellite products of these measures.

Biomass density from remote sensing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Whilst relationships can be calibrated between optical remote sensing measurements transformed to vegetation indices, and (above ground) biomass (e.g. Samimi and Kraus, 2004), these tend to be only quite local in their application, partly due to factors such as non-green biomass to which are not accounted for in such data (Gamon et al., 1995). There are arguments that a time integral of measures such as NDVI can provide more robust estimates, but this is essentially based on a PEM view of GPP and NPP and discussed more below.

The most promising EO technologies for biomass estimation are radar and lidar. The main reason for radar being useful is that the longer wavelength SARs in particular are mainly responsive to scattering from particlular tree branch/trunk components so backscatter can be broadly related to biomass. A problem is the saturation of these relationships at high biomass volumes.

SAR backscatter data can be supplemented with height estimates from interferometry in some cases, but decoherence over vegetation canopies makes this difficult to achieve with repeat pass methods. If height can be estimated, then allometric relationships can be applied to estimate AGB. Height estimates however require some estimate of both the scattering height in the canopy and the ground scattering height. This can sometimes be achieved with polarimetric data. In fact, decoherence itself is seen as a source of information, the idea being essentially that the decoherence is greater the higher the trees.

Another technology of value here is lidar measuremenmt, which aims to estimate tree or canopy height from the detection of ground and crown responses in a lidar waveform or the detection of ground and crown lidar 'hits' in discrete lidar data. Again, the translation to biomass relies on allometric relationships with height.

Measurement and inference of rates
-----------------------------------

Flux tower measurements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A good deal of what has been learned about the processes involved in terrestrial carbon, most certainly when it comes to testing models, has been done on the back of flux tower measurements. The majority of these use 'eddy covariance' methods that, under turbulent wind conditions, allow measurement of Net Ecosystem Productivity to be inferred from gas excahnge measurements (water vapour and CO2 mainly, but also e.g. methane). NEP can be inferred from the intergral of these measurements. Because they require turbulence, this method does not work well at night generally, so forms of 'gap filling' are applied. Other rate terms such as NEP or GPP can be inferred from the NEP data, usually through the application of a model.

For terrestrial ecosytems, instruments are generally mounted on a tower above the vegetation. Thy measure gas exchange from a 'footprint' around the tower, where the size of this depends on factors such as vegetation roughness (but may typically be around 1 km) and the direction of the footpring relative to the tower depends on the wind direction.

Other methods rely on measuring concentrations of gases, rather than fluxes. Fluxes can then be inferred assuming some model of atmospheric transport and surface exchange. These methods tend to cover larger areas. Examples are the 'ta;; towers' network, including e.g. measurements oon the `Angus mast in Scotland <http://www.geos.ed.ac.uk/abs/research/micromet/Current/chiotto/>`_.

Instruments such as the LiCor Li-8100A or other chamber instruments can be used for soil flux measurements or measurements over very short vegetation.

Remote Sensing measurements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is difficult to measure land surface rate terms directly from EO, but as reviewed by Grace et al. (2007) the closest we can get to these are probably those that directly relate to photosynthesis, such as fluorescence and PRI. There are certainly some complexities to the interpretation of such data, but it is very exciting to think that we can now demosntrate that such measurements are feasible from space.

Another technology that can measure something related to CO2 rates is fire radiative power from thermal instruments. This can be directly related to the rate of carbon release by fire and integrated to obtain the amount of biomass consumed by the fire.

The most *common* way of trying to estimate NPP and GPP from EO measurements involves the use of fAPAR or NDVI (or similar) measurements from optical data. We have seen earlier how fAPAR fits into estimates of GPP, both in the Sellers (1992) scaling of leaf photosynthesis and respiration and in the PEM approach. There is *much* literature on these subjects, but see Prince and Goward (1995) for one of the core papers on this. See also Potter et al. (1993). See e.g.  the various Gobron et al. papers for some background on fAPAR data.

Direct or indirect inference of LAI from EO is also relevant to driving and testing carbon models, so you should investigate papers on this subject (e.g. Baret et al. 2007)

One problem that has faced the EO community for some time is that there can be quite large discrepencies between different fAPAR and LAI products. This is partly down to different 'meanings' of LAI etc. (e.g. whether clumping is included, what sun angle the fAPAR data are for, whether they are fAPAR or interception). However, these same areas of 'confusion' also pervade the ecosystem modelling community.

Conclusions
------------

In these notes, we have tried to be reasonably comprehensive, if brief in pointing out some of the major measurement technologies for measuring carbon stocks and fluxes. The text is deliberately brief as the aim is for the students to pick a topic within those covered here (or in something related, in agreement with the course tutor)  and to prepare a short seminar on the subject. This is likely best conducted in small teams (e.g. 2 or 3 people). You should prepare a small number of slides, but mostly you should be in a position to talk to the rest of the class about the subject and respond to questions.

One of the implicit aims here is to make sure that you read around the subject, so, although this seminar is not formally assessed, we are expecting some intellectual depth to your presentation and discussion.

Since you will, of necessity, be concentrating on one of the topics above (or even part of one of these), you should make sure that in further reading following the seminar you delve into some of the key literature for the other topics.

The amount of time available for each talk will depend on the number of students taking the course, so this will be discussed with the course tutor.
