Lecture 3 and practical session 1 will be given by Prof. Martin Wooster, King's Colege London, Dept. Geography. Lecture will be in the Geography Pyramid room, 4th floor of the Strand building, located directly opposite Aldwych & the BBC World Service Building and next to Somerset House. Maps at: http://www.kcl.ac.uk/campuslife/campuses/strand/Strand.aspx.  KCL Main Entrance is on the Strand - a revolving door. Go into the foyer and along the corridor in front of you around 30 or 40 yards until you see lifts on the left.  Go up to Floor 4. Come out of the lifts and turn left. You are in geog Dept. The pyramid room is up the small stairs on your right and left along the cooridoor. Ask anyone in dept if you cant see it. It may be locked so wait outside - lecture is scheduled to start at 14:30. Details on practical location TBC.

Lecture 4 is a student-led exercise, where you will be expected to research topics in measurement related to terrestrial Carbon, and give a short seminar.
