GEOG0133  TERRESTRIAL CARBON: MODELLING and MONITORING
=======================================================

Aims of the course
------------------

The Terrestrial Carbon: modelling and monitoring module aims:

* To outline the role of vegetation in the carbon cycle and the wider climate system
* To outline how the vegetation carbon cycle can be modelled and use the models in prediction
* To provide the linkages between the models and remote sensing observations (radiative transfer)
* To enable the students to use remote sensing (and other) data to constrain, test and criticise the models
* To expose the students to modern statistical methods in combining data and models

Content of the course
---------------------

The module will cover:

* The role of vegetation in the climate system
* Terrestrial vegetation dynamics modelling 
* Remote sensing of vegetation
* Radiation interactions with vegetation
* Model inversion in remote sensing
* Concepts and maths of data assimilation
* Using remote sensing data to constrain and test vegetation dynamics models

Assessment
----------

2 hour unseen exam, 100% of the assessment.

Format of the course
--------------------

The module will be delivered through:

* Lectures (2 hour sessions providing concepts, contexts, and critiques)
* Computer laboratory work (extended practical sessions progressing technical aspects of model implementation and options hands-on experience of relevant software). Practicals will initially be based around specific vegetation models and EO radiative transfer schemes, but also include advanced concepts such as data assimilation.
* Moodle resources (hosting reading lists, lecture handouts, datasets, guides and practical support materials)

Learning outcomes
-----------------

At the end of the module, students should:

* Appreciate the role of vegetation in the carbon cycle and the climate system
* Appreciate the role, strengths and weaknesses of models of global vegetation processes
* Understand the factors affecting remote sensing measurements of vegetation (radiative transfer theory)
* Understand how to use models and observations in combination to improve estimates of carbon fluxes and pools 
* Have an understanding of data assimilation
